"""
This module provides a set of abstract interfaces aimed at simplifying the development of
applications following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. These interfaces form the
foundation for modeling complex business domains.

Classes
-------
IEntity:
    An interface representing entities, which are objects with a distinct identity that
    persists over time.

IRootEntity:
    An interface representing the root of an aggregate, a cluster of associated objects
    that are treated as a unit.

IValueObject:
    An interface for value objects, which are objects that contain attributes but do not
    have a conceptual identity.

IDomainEvent:
    An interface for domain events, which are discrete events that domain experts care about.

IRepository:
    An interface for repositories, which are mechanisms for retrieving entities and
    persisting them back to the database.

IFactory:
    An interface for factories, which are used to create domain objects.

IBuilder:
    An interface for builders, a specific kind of factory that is used to build complex
    objects step by step.

IDomainService:
    An interface for domain services, which are used when a significant process or
    transformation in the domain isn't a natural responsibility of an entity or value
    object.

IService:
    A generic service interface from which the more specific domain, application and
    infrastructure service interfaces derive.

IApplicationService:
    An interface for application services, which are used to drive the interactions between
    domain layer and user interface or external systems.

IInfrastructureService:
    An interface for infrastructure services, which provide technical capabilities that
    support the layers of the application.

class IService(abc.ABC):
    """
    An abstract base class that represents a Service in a software architecture.

    A Service is a part of the system's functionality that provides certain capabilities.
    These capabilities often involve interactions between different parts of the system,
    such as operations that involve multiple domain objects or that span multiple layers
    or subsystems of the architecture.

    In the context of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), a Service might be a Domain Service,
    an Application Service, or an Infrastructure Service, each having different
    responsibilities and roles within the system.

    The specific methods and properties of a Service would depend on what capabilities
    the Service provides.

    Example
    -------
    >>> class UserService(IService):

    ...         # Create a new user
    ...         pass

class IEntity(abc.ABC):
    """
    An abstract base class that adheres to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

    Entity

    In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), an Entity is a core concept that is not defined
    by its attributes, but rather by a thread of continuity and its identity.
    Entities are characterized by their identity and mutable state. They have
    the same ID throughout their lifecycle, even though their state may change.

    For example, consider a `User` entity in a system. Each user would have a
    unique ID to distinguish them, even if details such as their username or
    email change.

    In Python and DDD, Entities are often represented by classes, with each
    instance representing a unique entity. These classes would have methods
    defining behavior related to the entity, and their instances would carry
    an ID to ensure identity continuity.

    This IEntity class represents such an entity, with an abstract `id` property
    and equality determined by this `id`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    id : Any, abstract
        Unique identity attribute of the entity.

    Methods
    -------
    __eq__(entity) -> bool:
        Determines equality based on id.

    Example
    -------
    >>> class User(IEntity):
    ...     def __init__(self, id, name):
    ...         self._id = id
    ...         self.name = name
    ...     @property
    ...     def id(self):
    ...         return self._id

class IRootEntity(IEntity):
    """
    An abstract base class that represents an Aggregate Root in Domain-Driven Design.

    In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), an Aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that
    can be treated as a single unit. An Aggregate Root is an entity inside the
    Aggregate that other objects are accessed through, ensuring the rules of the
    Aggregate are not violated.

    This class extends IEntity, meaning it has a unique ID and equality is based
    on this ID. As an Aggregate Root, it is expected to control and coordinate
    activities within its Aggregate.

    Attributes
    ----------
    Inherits the 'id' attribute from IEntity.

    Example
    -------
    >>> class Team(IRootEntity):

    """


class IValueObject(abc.ABC):
    """
    An abstract base class that represents a Value Object in Domain-Driven Design.

    In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), a Value Object is an object that is defined by its
    value or attributes, rather than a unique identity. Value Objects are often used
    to describe aspects of a domain and are typically immutable.

    This class prohibits setting of attributes post-instantiation to enforce
    immutability, and defines equality in terms of attribute equality.

    Methods
    -------
    __setattr__(__name, __value) -> None:
        Overridden to prohibit attribute mutation.

    __eq__(value_object) -> bool:
        Abstract method to check equality of Value Objects.
